# PaidFly

**PaidFly** is a plugin designed for Minecraft servers that allows players to fly by consuming (in-game currency/experience points)!

## Features

- Supports players flying by paying with in-game currency/experience points
- Supports Title, Action, and sound notifications
- Supports countdown notifications
- Accumulates payment during flight and settles it when flight ends
- Checks the balance at each billing interval without issuing a withdrawal

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of **`PaidFly.jar`** from the [plugin release page](https://github.com/coderxi1/PaidFly/releases) (if the server has `kotlin-stdlib`, you can use `PaidFly-kotlin.jar` )
2. Place the plugin in the server's `plugins/` folder
3. To allow players to use it, set the `paidfly.fly` permission for the default user group
4. If using experience for flying, ensure the **Vault** economy plugin is installed on the server.

## Configuration

```yaml
Main:
  PayType: Money        # Payment mode
  PayInterval: 3s       # Payment interval
  PayCost: 0.5          # Cost per interval
  AutoOffThreshold: 0.5 # Turn off flight if below this value (recommended to set same as PayCost)
```

Payment is accumulated in memory while a player is flying. At each billing interval, PaidFly only checks whether the current balance can cover the accumulated amount and the auto-off threshold; it does not withdraw money or experience. The accumulated amount is withdrawn once when flight ends, the player quits, the plugin is reloaded, or the server shuts down. Incomplete billing intervals are not charged.
